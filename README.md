## User Story
As a traveler I want a web application that can help me find beers based off of the current weather conditions so that i can enjoy beer that fits the weather.

## Acceptance Criteria

This application will allow a user to search for a location's forecast along with a suggestion of the top brewerys in the area. It will prioritize 
the type of brewery based on how the weather is.
